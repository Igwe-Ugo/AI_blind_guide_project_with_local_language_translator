# PROJECT TITLE:
AI Blind guide with local language translator
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project presents a comprehensive solution aimed at assisting visually impaired individuals through the integration of hardware and software components. The hardware component utilizes the ESP32-CAM module, programmed with Arduino code, to capture real-time video frames. These frames are then processed by a Python-based GUI developed using Tkinter, providing a user-friendly interface for interaction. The GUI displays the video feed and incorporates object detection algorithms to identify objects within the environment. Additionally, the system provides audio feedback based on detected objects, enhancing the user's understanding of their surroundings. However, the project faces challenges such as the lack of standalone functionality and potential issues with audio repetition. Proposed solutions include developing a bootable Python script to automate system startup and implementing delays in audio feedback to mitigate repetition.
To address the standalone functionality limitation, the project outlines steps to create a bootable Python script for seamless system initialization on the ESP32-CAM. This approach ensures that the system is ready for use upon startup, enhancing user convenience and accessibility. Furthermore, measures are proposed to alleviate potential audio repetition issues by introducing delays between audio feedback iterations. By fine-tuning the timing of audio cues, the system aims to deliver a more fluid and user-friendly experience for visually impaired individuals, promoting greater independence and ease of navigation in various environments. Through these combined hardware and software innovations, the project strives to offer an effective and inclusive solution for enhancing the daily lives of visually impaired individuals.
